This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel.
We are under assault. I
repeat, we are under assault.
Aliens are dead, sliced open...
Requesting aid from any
vessel within range...
Our crew is made of Asgardian
families, we have very few soldiers here.
This is not a war craft, I
repeat, this is not a war craft.
Hear me... and rejoice.
You have had the privilege
of being saved
by the Great Titan.
You may think this is suffering.
No.
It is salvation.
Universal scales
tipped toward balance
because of your sacrifice.
Smile
for even in death
you have become
Children of Thanos.
I know what it's like to lose.
To feel so desperately
that you're right,
yet to fail nonetheless.
As lightning
turns the legs to jelly.
I ask you
to what end?
Dread it, run from it...
Destiny arrives all the same.
And now, it's here.
Or should I say...
I am.
You talk too much.
The Tesseract.
Or, your brother's head.
I assume you have a preference?
Oh, I do.
Kill away.
All right, stop!
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.
You really are the worst, brother.
I assure you, brother. The
sun will shine on us again.
Your optimism is
misplaced, Asgardian.
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.
And for another...
we have a Hulk.
Let him have his fun.
Forefathers...
Let the dark magic, flow
through me one last... time.
That was a mistake.
No!
You are going to die for that!
My humble personage...
bows before your grandeur.
No other being, has
ever had the might,
nay, the nobility,
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.
The Universe,
lies within your grasp.
There are two more
Stones on Earth.
Find them, my Children, and
bring them to me on Titan.
- Father, we will not fail you.
- If I might, interject...
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.
I do have a bit of
experience in that arena.
If you consider failure experience.
I consider experience, experience.
Almighty Thanos.
I, Loki, Prince of Asgard...
Odin-son...
The rightful king of Jotunheim,
God of Mischief...
Do hereby pledge to you,
my undying fidelity.
"Undying"?
You should choose your
words more carefully.
You...
will never be...
a god.
No resurrections this time.
No... Loki...
Seriously? You don't
have any money?
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.
I'll tell the guys at the deli.
Maybe they'll make you a
metaphysical Ham and Rye.
- Wait, wait. I think I got a 200.
- Dollars?
- Rupees.
- Which is?
I wouldn't say no
to a Tuna Melt.
Thanos is coming.
We've got to...
Who?
Slow down. I'm
totally not kidding.
- No, I'm not.
- Your rambling lost me.
Look, you know how you're having a
dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?
Yeah.
Okay, then you're like, my
God, there's no bathroom,
what am I gonna do? Oh!
Someone's watching!
Right. And then you wake up, and in
real life you actually have to pee.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Everybody has that.
Right. That's the point
I'm trying to make.
Last night, I dreamt,
we had a kid.
So real.
We named him after
your eccentric uncle.
- What was his name? Porsey. Morgan.
- Right.
So you woke up,
and we were...
- Expecting.
- Yeah.
- Yes?
- No.
- I had a dream about it. It was so real.
- If you wanted to have a kid...
You wouldn't have done that.
I'm glad you brought this up
cause it's nothing,
just a housing unit for nano-parts.
- It's not helping your case. OK?
- It's an attachment. It's not a...
- You don't need that.
- I know. I had the surgery.
I'm just trying to protect us.
The future, as is, and that's it.
Just in case there's a monster in
the closet. Just letting you know.
Shirts.
You know me so well.
You finish all my sentences.
You should have shirts
in your closet.
Yeah. You know what
there should be?
No more surprises. We'll
have a nice dinner tonight.
We should have no more surprises.
Ever. I should promise you.
- Yeah.
- I will.
Tony Stark,
I'm Dr. Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.
Oh. Congratulations on
the wedding, by the way.
I'm sorry. You giving
out tickets or something?
We need your help.
Look, it's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the Universe is at stake.
And who's "we"?
- Hey, Tony.
- Bruce!
You okay?
From the dawn of the Universe,
there was nothing.
Then, boom!
The Big Bang sends
six elemental crystals,
hurdling across the virgin Universe.
These Infinity Stones
each control an essential
aspect of existence.
Space.
Reality.
Power.
Soul.
Mind.
And Time.
- Tell me his name again.
- Thanos.
He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.
He wipes out half the population.
He sent Loki.
The attack on New York. That's him.
- What's our time line?
- No telling.
He has the Power and Space Stones,
that only makes him the strongest
creature in the whole Universe.
If he gets his hands, on
all six Stones, Tony...
He can destroy life on a scale
of hitherto hundredth of.
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto hundredth of"?
Are you seriously leaning on
the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
Is that what that is?
I'm going to allow that.
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just stick this
one down the garbage disposal?
No can do.
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.
And I swore off dairy, but Ben &
Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- It's not bad.
A bit chalky.
"A Hunka-Hulka Burning
Fudge" is our favorite.
- That's a thing?
- Whatever. Point is, things change.
Our oath to protect the
Time Stone cannot change.
This Stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.
And still conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us!
Only if we don't do our jobs.
What is your job exactly,
besides making balloon animals?
Protecting your
reality, douche bag.
Okay guys, can we quick cable
this discussion right now?
The fact is we have the stone.
We know where it is.
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone.
And we have to find him now.
- Yeah, that's the thing.
- What do you mean?
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder. He's offline.
What?
- Tony, you lost another super bot?
- I didn't lose him. He's more than that.
- He's evolving.
- Who could find Vision, then?
- Probably Steve Rogers.
- Oh, great.
Maybe. But...
Call him.
It's not that easy.
God, we haven't caught up in a spell,
have we?
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.
Broke up?
- Like a band? Like The Beatles?
- Cap and I fell out hard.
We're not on speaking terms.
Tony, listen to me.
Thor's gone.
Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to
be moving your hair, would you?
Not at the moment, no.
You okay?
- Help him. Wong, Doc.
- Got it.
- Friday, what am I looking at?
- Not sure. I'm working on it.
You better not put that Time
Stone in your back pocket, Doc!
I might wanna use it.
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.
Holy shit!
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!
What's the matter with you kids?
You never seen a spaceship before?
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd
Street, notify first responders.
Will do.
Hear me, and rejoice!
You are about to die at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.
Be thankful, that your meaningless
lives are now contributing to...
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.
You better pack it up
and get outta here.
Stone keeper...
Does this chattering
animal speak for you?
Certainly not. I speak for myself.
There's no trespassing in
this city and on this planet.
- You need to get lost, Squidward!
- They exhaust me.
Bring me the Stone.
Hey, do you want a piece?
No, not really. But when
do I ever get what I want.
Been a while. Good
to have you, buddy.
I just... I need to
concentrate for a second.
Come on, come on, Max.
Where's your guy?
I don't know. We're
certainly having a thing.
There's no time for a thing. That's
the thing right there. Let's go.
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.
- I can't... He won't...
- It's okay. Stand down.
- Can I leave you with him? Thank you.
- I have him.
- Where'd that come from?
- It's nano-tech. You like it? A little...
Dr. Banner, if the rest of your
green friend won't be joining us...
- You gotta get that stone outta here, now.
- It stays with me.
Exactly. Bye!
Tony, you okay? How we doing?
Good, bad?
Really good. Do you plan on helping out?
I'm trying. He won't come out.
Come on, Hulk.
